### React Components

<Img src='./img/components.jpeg' width={700} />

---

### React Components

- Declarative
- Encapsulate state
- Composable

---

### Declarative

- Declare how your view will look like
- React will update DOM or another host tree

---

### Encapsulate State

- Each component can manage their own state

---

### Composable

- You can compose components to create complex UIs

---

## React Components

---

### Props

- Properties to modify a component
- Read only, can't be modified

---

### State

- Something that will change in the scope of the component

---

## React Components

---

### Effects

- Side effect created by a component

---

### Component Dichotomy

- It acts as a pure function in some cases
- It acts as a stateful logics in some cases
- It can cause side effects in some cases

---

### Component Dichotomy

- classes was used to represent stateful logic
- functions was used to represent pure logics

---

### React Hooks

- Bring stateful logic and side effects to functions components
- it is all about co-location

---

### Before Hooks

---

### After Hooks

<Img src='./img/hooksAfter.jpeg' width={350} />
